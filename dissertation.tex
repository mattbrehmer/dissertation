% Template for a UBC-compliant dissertation
% At the minimum, you will need to change http://goo.gl/ulvi0Bthe information found

%
%!TEX TS-program = pdflatex
%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode

%% The ubcdiss class provides several options:
%%   fogscopy
%%       set parameters to exactly how FoGS specifies
%%         * single-sided
%%         * page-numbering starts from title page
%%         * the lists of figures and tables have each entry prefixed
%%           with 'Figure' or 'Table'
%%       This can be tested by `\iffogscopy ... \else ... \fi'
%%   10pt, 11pt, 12pt
%%       set default font size
%%   oneside, twoside
%%       whether to format for single-sided or double-sided printing
%%   balanced
%%       when double-sided, ensure page content is centred
%%       rather than slightly offset (the default)
%%   singlespacing, onehalfspacing, doublespacing
%%       set default inter-line text spacing; the ubcdiss class
%%       provides \textspacing to revert to this configured spacing
%%   draft
%%       disable more intensive processing, such as including
%%       graphics, etc.

%% If you're feeling brave, have lots of time, and wish to use one
%% your platform's native fonts, see the commented out bits below for
%% XeTeX/XeLaTeX.  This is not for the faint at heart.

%% Recommended packages
%%
\usepackage{checkend}	% better error messages on left-open environments
\usepackage{graphicx}	% for incorporating external images

%% booktabs: provides some special commands for typesetting tables as used
%% in excellent journals.  Ignore the examples in the Lamport book!
\usepackage{booktabs}

%% listings: useful support for including source code listings, with
%% optional special keyword formatting.  The \lstset{} causes
%% the text to be typeset in a smaller sans serif font, with
%% proportional spacing.
\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{basicstyle=\sffamily\scriptsize,showstringspaces=false,fontadjust}

%% The acronym package provides support for defining acronyms, providing
%% their expansion when first used, and building glossaries.  See the
%% example in glossary.tex and the example usage throughout the example
%% document.
%% NOTE: to use \MakeTextLowercase in the \acsfont command below,
%%   we *must* use the `nohyperlinks' option -- it causes errors with
%%   hyperref otherwise.  See Section 5.2 in the ``LaTeX 2e for Class
%%   and Package Writers Guide'' (clsguide.pdf) for details.
\usepackage[printonlyused,nohyperlinks]{acronym}
%% The ubcdiss.cls loads the `textcase' package which provides commands
%% for upper-casing and lower-casing text.  The following causes
%% the acronym package to typeset acronyms in small-caps
%% as recommended by Bringhurst.
% \renewcommand{\acsfont}[1]{{\scshape \MakeTextLowercase{#1}}}

%% color: add support for expressing colour models.  Grey can be used
%% to great effect to emphasize other parts of a graphic or text.
%% For an excellent set of examples, see Tufte's "Visual Display of
%% Quantitative Information" or "Envisioning Information".
\usepackage[usenames,dvipsnames]{color}
% \definecolor{greytext}{gray}{0.5}
\usepackage[usenames,dvipsnames,table]{xcolor}    % loads also ÈcolortblÇ
\definecolor{greytext}{RGB}{119,119,119}

%% comment: provides a new {comment} environment: all text inside the
%% environment is ignored.
%%   \begin{comment} ignored text ... \end{comment}
\usepackage{comment}

%% The natbib package provides more sophisticated citing commands
%% such as \citeauthor{} to provide the author names of a work,
%% \citet{} to produce an author-and-reference citation,
%% \citep{} to produce a parenthetical citation.
%% We use \citeeg{} to provide examples
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}
\newcommand{\citeeg}[1]{\citep[e.g.,][]{#1}}
\usepackage{bibentry}
\nobibliography*

%% The titlesec package provides commands to vary how chapter and
%% section titles are typeset.  The following uses more compact
%% spacings above and below the title.  The titleformat that follow
%% ensure chapter/section titles are set in singlespace.
\usepackage[compact]{titlesec}
\titleformat*{\section}{\singlespacing\raggedright\bfseries\Large}
\titleformat*{\subsection}{\singlespacing\raggedright\bfseries\large}
\titleformat*{\subsubsection}{\singlespacing\raggedright\bfseries}
\titleformat*{\paragraph}{\singlespacing\raggedright\itshape}

%% The caption package provides support for varying how table and
%% figure captions are typeset.
\usepackage[format=hang,indention=-1cm,labelfont={bf},margin=1em]{caption}
% \usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage{ccicons}

%% url: for typesetting URLs and smart(er) hyphenation.
%% \url{http://...}

%%
%% Possibly useful packages: you may need to explicitly install
%% these from CTAN if they aren't part of your distribution;
%% teTeX seems to ship with a smaller base than MikTeX and MacTeX.
%%
\usepackage{pdfpages}	% insert pages from other PDF files
%\usepackage{longtable}	% provide tables spanning multiple pages
%\usepackage{chngpage}	% support changing the page widths on demand
%\usepackage{tabularx}	% an enhanced tabular environment

%% enumitem: support pausing and resuming enumerate environments.
%\usepackage{enumitem}

%% rotating: provides two environments, sidewaystable and sidewaysfigure,
%% for typesetting tables and figures in landscape mode.
%\usepackage{rotating}

%% subfig: provides for including subfigures within a figure,
%% and includes being able to separately reference the subfigures.
% \usepackage{subfig}

%% ragged2e: provides several new new commands \Centering, \RaggedLeft,
%% \RaggedRight and \justifying and new environments Center, FlushLeft,
%% FlushRight and justify, which set ragged text and are easily
%% configurable to allow hyphenation.
%\usepackage{ragged2e}

%% The ulem package provides a \sout{} for striking out text and
%% \xout for crossing out text.  The normalem and normalbf are
%% necessary as the package messes with the emphasis and bold fonts
%% otherwise.
%\usepackage[normalem,normalbf]{ulem}    % for \sout

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% HYPERREF:
%% The hyperref package provides for embedding hyperlinks into your
%% document.  By default the table of contents, references, citations,
%% and footnotes are hyperlinked.
%%
%% Hyperref provides a very handy command for doing cross-references:
%% \autoref{}.  This is similar to \ref{} and \pageref{} except that
%% it automagically puts in the *type* of reference.  For example,
%% referencing a figure's label will put the text `Figure 3.4'.
%% And the text will be hyperlinked to the appropriate place in the
%% document.
%%
%% Generally hyperref should appear after most other packages

%% The following puts hyperlinks in very faint grey boxes.
%% The `pagebackref' causes the references in the bibliography to have
%% back-references to the citing page; `backref' puts the citing section
%% number.  See further below for other examples of using hyperref.
%% 2009/12/09: now use `linktocpage' (Jacek Kisynski): FoGS now prefers
%%   that the ToC, LoF, LoT place the hyperlink on the page number,
%%   rather than the entry text.

% \usepackage{mathptmx}
% \usepackage{graphicx}
% \usepackage{times}
% \usepackage{epstopdf}

%% bibliography when `backref' or `pagebackref' are used
\renewcommand\backrefpagesname{\(\rightarrow\) pages}
\renewcommand\backref{\textcolor{greytext} \backrefpagesname\ }

%% The following uses most defaults, which causes hyperlinks to be
%% surrounded by colourful boxes; the colours are only visible in
%% PDFs and don't show up when printed:
%\usepackage[bookmarks,bookmarksnumbered]{hyperref}

%% The following disables the colourful boxes around hyperlinks.
%\usepackage[bookmarks,bookmarksnumbered,pdfborder={0 0 0}]{hyperref}

%% The following disables all hyperlinking, but still enabled use of
%% \autoref{}
%\usepackage[draft]{hyperref}

%% The following commands causes chapter and section references to
%% uppercase the part name.
\renewcommand{\chapterautorefname}{Chapter}
\renewcommand{\sectionautorefname}{Section}
\renewcommand{\subsectionautorefname}{Section}
\renewcommand{\subsubsectionautorefname}{Section}
