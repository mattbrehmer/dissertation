\chapter[Appendix: Task Typology (A Chronology)]{Task Typology Supplemental Material: A Chronology}
\label{app:typology}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This appendix supports \autoref{ch:typology}.
It contains an chronological annotated bibliography of references which led to a meta-analysis of existing classifications, as well as a progression of diagrams that represent the evolution of our typology\index{task!task typology} of abstract visualization tasks\index{task} between late 2012 and early 2013.

In this section, I reconstruct a chronological account of the evolution of our task typology\index{task!task typology} and its bibliography between 2011 and 2013.
For each reference consulted, I took notes and recorded the date, and this information was maintained in a wiki document that I shared with Tamara; I reproduce some of this material here, along with comments regarding relevant events and project milestones.
References are denoted by the order in which they were consulted with [R-\#].
The structure of this annotated bibliography is a combination of commentary, the vocabulary of prior classifications (demarcated with {\it an italic font}), and references to other works.
Most of these references were cited in \autoref{ch:typology} and in \citet{Brehmer2013}; other references listed below may have been cited in an earlier draft or in the original paper submission, and these instances are remarked upon throughout this appendix.

My literature search progressed as follows: for each reference consulted, I reviewed its bibliography as well as the subsequent works that cite it (for the latter, I consulted Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore\footnote{\url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/}}, and the ACM Digital Library\footnote{\url{http://dl.acm.org/}}, depending on where the source was published).
This process allowed me to collect more references that propose a classification of tasks, activities, interactions\index{interaction}, and the like, or those that discuss the theoretical foundations for such classifications.

\section{Preliminary Influences}

\bstart{October, 2011}
Work on topic of classifying visualization tasks\index{task} began in earnest in September 2012.
However, I had already consulted a great deal of relevant previous work between the beginning of my PhD studies (October 2011) and September 2012, during which time I was concentrating primarily on the interview study (\autoref{ch:drvistasks}) and field study (\autoref{ch:overview}) projects, having throughout this period a conscious interest in evaluation\index{evaluation} methodologies for visualization.

    North also suggests that we measure insight\index{insight} in a qualitative, unconstrained way with real domain users interacting with their own data.
    A rigorous coding protocol would be required for such studies.
    On the other hand, the experimenter no longer needs to design benchmark tasks.

\bstart{December 8, 2011}
I prepared a summary of the literature I had reviewed up until this point in a presentation entitled {\it ``The black box\ldots of Sensemaking and Scientific Discovery''}.
As the title suggests, I discussed sensemaking\index{sensemaking} and information foraging\index{information foraging} models of \citet{Pirolli2009}, and I distinguished between the high-level data analysis taxonomies of \citet{Amar2004} and \citet{Springmeyer1992}, the low-level data analysis taxonomy of \citet{Winckler2004}, and the scientific discovery process described by \citet{Klahr1999}.
I attempted to establish commonalities between these models and taxonomies and their relevance to the visualization and visual analytics\index{visual analytics} communities, making references to arguments by \citet{Thomas2005} and \citet{vanWijk2006}.
I indicated the need for a classification of {\it mid-level activities}, calling upon constructs such as {\it insight\index{insight}, discovery, serendipity, learning, creativity}, and {\it problem solving}.
I also pointed out that metrics associated with any of these constructs are difficult to define and that the evaluation\index{evaluation} of visual analysis and visualization processes will likely involve multiple metrics related to more than one of these constructs.
Altogether, my thinking about these constructs in the context of evaluating\index{evaluation} visualization was rather nebulous and unfocused in retrospect, and it was not yet clear as to what this line of thinking would lead to.
Nevertheless, I continued with the literature review in a part-time capacity over the course of the next nine months.

    One view is that that insight\index{insight} is an event; and other view characterizes insight\index{insight} as a quantity, an amount of knowledge gained that occurs upon integrating and building upon one's existing representations, making associations between disparate concepts. 
    While neither is trivial to track or measure, the authors suggest that in the context of visualization, the two forms of insight\index{insight} support each other and occur in a loop, wherein knowledge-based insight\index{insight} elicits or enables event-based insight\index{insight}.

    They describe aspects that promote the use of visualization artefacts in casual settings such as personal interest, usefulness, curiosity, data correctness and trust, the cost of misinterpretation, and aesthetics. 
    They also describe aspects that inhibit the use of visualization artefacts in these settings: time constraints and higher priority tasks\index{task}, learning effort, and insufficient data context.

    A person's goals in these contexts can be {\it extrinsic} (motivated by social pressure or a desire to avoid boredom) and {\it intrinsic}, which can be distinguished by referring to {\it learning and understanding} ({\it curiosity, information acquisition}), {\it utility} ({\it instruction, scheduling, task completion, orientation}), and {\it entertainment} ({\it humour, self-expression}).

\section{Dedicated Literature Review}
\label{app:typology:chronology:dedicated}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

\bstart{September, 2012}
As mentioned at the start of the previous section, a deliberate effort toward a classification of tasks began in September 2012, when we began to consolidate notes from the aforementioned sources and we initiated a dedicated literature review of additional classifications and associated frameworks or theories.

At this time I had arrived at an impasse in both the interview study (\autoref{ch:drvistasks}) and field study (\autoref{ch:overview}) projects, which I had been working on in parallel up until this point.
Our 2012 IEEE InfoVis submission about the interview study had been rejected (we then published it as a technical report~\cite{Sedlmair2012b}), as reviewers found the connections to visualization to be tenuous. 
Meanwhile, with regards to the field study, I mentioned an explicit need for a classification of visualization tasks among my preliminary field study findings (see \autoref{app:overview:preliminary-results}):

\begin{quotation}
    {\it ``A valid and comparative evaluation\index{evaluation} methodology requires a robust mid-level task\index{task} characterization of exploratory data analysis, one that spans domains and tool interfaces. \ldots My long-term goal is to contribute to the construction of such a task\index{task} characterization.''} 
\end{quotation}

As indicated in this quote, my interest in developing a classification of tasks\index{task} was motivated out of an interest in qualitative evaluation.
However, over the next few months, I would come to realize the value of a classification of tasks in other contexts, such as in visualization design and quantitative evaluation.

Meanwhile, Tamara had been thinking about task\index{task} classification in the context of the book she was writing\footnote{which would be published over a year later~\cite{Munzner2014}.}, and she was struggling to reconcile existing classifications by \citet{Amar2004}, \citet{Amar2005}, \citet{Casner1991}, \citet{Lee2006}, \citet{Shneiderman1996}, \citet{Wehrend1990}, \citet{Yi2007}, \citet{Zhou1998} and a new classification by \citet{Heer2012}.
She had already sketched out some ideas as to how a classification of tasks\index{task} could be presented, such as in \autoref{app:typology:fig:12-08-27}.
It became clear at this point that Tamara and I had similar goals: in my case, I was in need of task classification a data analysis tool to use in my projects, whereas Tamara was in need of task classification to communicate concepts in her book.
We then decided to continue our literature review and meta-analysis of existing classifications toward a new task classification.

    Roth identifies several concordances and differences across the classifications that he surveyed: the terms {\it identify} and {\it compare} are the most common; most {\it objective}-oriented classifications are at a high-level of abstraction; {\it objective} and {\it operator} classifications are often hard to delineate; {\it brushing}\index{view coordination!brushing across views} is the most common {\it operator}, {\it focusing} is defined in many different ways, there is ambiguity related to {\it changing or altering the encoding\index{visual encoding} or symbolization}; {\it viewpoint operators} are related to {\it distortion, navigation, observer motion, object rotation, panning, re-centring, re-projecting, viewpoint manipulation, and zooming}; {\it operand} classifications vary between being {\it type-centric} and {\it state-centric}, while others vary between {\it data operands} and {\it representation operands}.

Some discussion at BELIV included arguments against task classification: that tasks\index{task} are nonlinear systems, and that new contexts, new data types, and changes of scale result in new tasks all the time; further complexity is added with collaborative tasks and tasks spread over multiple tools.

I also noted several papers of potential relevance at InfoVis/VAST~\cite{Cottam2012,Crouser2012,Lee2012,Pohl2012}, and at BELIV~\cite{Gleicher2012,Mcnamara2012} which I would add to our literature review and meta analysis over the next few months.

\section{Meta-Analysis of Existing Classifications}
\label{app:typology:meta-analysis}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

\bstart{November 2012 -- January 2013}
After surveying the sources listed up until this point, Tamara and I began to characterize the dimensions and foci of existing classifications (Figures~\ref{app:typology:fig:high-mid-low} and~\ref{app:typology:fig:domain-vs-interface} and \autoref{app:typology:table:survey}).
These figures are culled from eight slide presentations generated between November 2012 and March 2013\footnote{489 slides in total, with an average of 60 slides per presentation.}, as a slide presentation was the primary medium in which we consolidated, framed, refined, and commented on our ideas. 

This meta-analysis eventually culminated in the discussion in \autoref{typology:rw} and in \autoref{typology:tab:rw:why} and \autoref{typology:tab:rw:how}.

\autoref{app:typology:fig:high-mid-low} indicates some of the dimensions considered in this meta-analysis of existing classifications, along with examples of high-level\index{task!high-level tasks}, mid-level\index{task!mid-level tasks}, and low-level tasks\index{task!low-level tasks}.
These dimensions refer to the domains interested in studying the tasks, the domain-specificity of the task, the linearity of the task, whether the tasks can be performed with variation from person to person, how the tasks could be studied, and how these tasks are supported.

Meanwhile, \autoref{app:typology:fig:domain-vs-interface} presents another view of our meta-analysis, in which our notion of ``mid-level tasks'' are described as being interface- and domain-independent.

\autoref{app:typology:table:survey} summarizes the metadata associated with existing classifications, which included bibliographic information, the depth or number of hierarchical levels in the particular classification, and meta-classifications terms originating with \citet{Roth2012a} and \citet{Chuah1996}, as well as the method or means by which the classification was developed.

I also continued to consult additional literature during this period.

\section{Our Initial Classifications of Tasks}
\label{app:typology:chronology:initial}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

\bstart{November 2012 -- February 2013}
At this point, Tamara and I had examined the vocabulary and definitions used in the existing classifications that we had surveyed.
Our meta-analysis reflected a top-down perspective, in which we had established the dimensions on which we could distinguish prior classifications.
However, this process did not yield our own classification of tasks\index{task}; to do so, we tried for a bottom-up approach, in which we would begin with a small set of existing classifications and gradually add and combine similar terms and remove redundant or duplicate terms, and we would continue to do so we considered additional classifications and the definitions that their authors had provided for the terms they contained.
we relied upon affinity diagramming\index{affinity diagramming} using tools such as OmniGraffle\footnote{\url{https://omnigroup.com/omnigraffle}}, Keynote\footnote{\url{http://apple.com/mac/keynote/}}, as well as post-its and whiteboards.
The diagrams and images that follow appeared throughout the eight slide presentations mentioned in \autoref{app:typology:meta-analysis}.
We began by consolidating the classifications of \citet{Heer2012}, \citet{Springmeyer1992}, \citet{Amar2005}, \citet{Gotz2008}, and \citet{Chuah1996}, as shown in \autoref{app:typology:fig:12.11.21}.

At this point, our notion of an ideal {\it task taxonomy} was one that describes tasks\index{task} at a middle level of abstraction, is domain- and interface-independent, focusing on the semantics of tasks (their objective or intent) and their temporal or sequential dependencies.
Such as taxonomy would have {\it descriptive}, {\it evaluative}, and {\it generative} power~\cite{Beaudouin-Lafon2004}, providing {\it actionable} and {\it persuasive} guidance~\cite{Gleicher2012} for visualization design and evaluation.
Our plan was to translate existing classifications into a semantic and objective language (\ie the active voice, a stance encouraged in qualitative data analysis and grounded theory\index{grounded theory} in particular~\cite{Charmaz2006}), identify emergent patterns following this translation, and attempt to map root nodes of low-level classifications to the leaf nodes of high-level classifications.

Through multiple rounds of coding\index{coding (qualitative data analysis)}, we continued to group similar terms and consider additional classifications, we selected representative terms for each group, and we arranged these representative terms into multiple levels of abstraction. 
This process is reflected in \autoref{app:typology:fig:12.11.23}, \autoref{app:typology:fig:12.11.28-whiteboard}, and \autoref{app:typology:fig:12.11.30}.
In our second classification, (\autoref{app:typology:fig:12.11.23}), we considered an reorganization around {\tt explore} and ``provenance\index{analytical provenance} tasks'' (the latter referring mostly to data and process management, inspired by the {\it process and provenance\index{analytical provenance}} classification by \citet{Heer2012}).
In both cases, leaf nodes pointed to operands (aspects of the data or view).
This reorganization also reflects a hybrid between the bottom-up approach reflected in \autoref{app:typology:fig:12.11.21} and the high-level top-down thinking reflected in Tamara's early proposal (see \autoref{app:typology:fig:12-08-27}).
% This section documents these multiple rounds of coding\index{coding (qualitative data analysis)} with diagrams reflecting the evolution of our typology (Figures~\ref{app:typology:fig:12.11.21} --~\ref{app:typology:fig:13.03.13}).

In our third classification (\autoref{app:typology:fig:12.11.30}), we introduced the questions of {\it why} (ends, objectives, goals), {\it what} (operands), {\it which} (also referring to operands), and {\it how} (means, methods, operators); we also considered the special case of {\it search}.
The objective, operator, and operand language is attributed to \citet{Norman1988}, which had also inspired a meta-analysis of cartographic interaction\index{interaction} classifications by \citet{Roth2012a}\index{cartography}.

    A discussion of distributed cognition\index{distributed cognition} theory in the context of visualization, distinguishing between {\it epistemic}\index{distributed cognition!epistemic actions} and {\it pragmatic} actions\index{distributed cognition!pragmatic actions}.
    Pragmatic actions\index{distributed cognition!pragmatic actions} are explicitly and consciously goal-directed, while epistemic actions\index{distributed cognition!epistemic actions} serve to coordinate actors' internal mental models with external representations of information.
    
    Information is propagated as a series of {\it representation states}, some are external within or between representations and artefacts, while some are internal to individuals (or shared between individuals).
    In the context of visualization, distributed cognition\index{distributed cognition} can help us to acknowledge both external and internal states of information, to capture the process of coupling, coordination, interaction\index{interaction} strategies for sensemaking\index{sensemaking} and analytical reasoning, the creation and evolution of external representations, and the role of interaction\index{interaction} in aiding understanding. 
    
    The authors state: ``{\it A science of interaction should not be just a taxonomy of interaction techniques or a framework of the abstracted task\index{task} procedures; it should be a scientific approach to understand how cognition emerges as a property of interaction between internal and external representations.}''

    Contributes a datatype specific classification of interaction\index{interaction} primitives relating to cartographic\index{cartography} data based on Norman's {\it Stages of Action} model, distinguishing between {\it goals} (or {\it meta-objectives}: {\it procure, predict, prescribe}), {\it objectives} ({\it identify, compare, rank, associate, delineate}), {\it operators}, and {\it operands}.
    \end{sloppypar}
    
    Among Roth's list of {\it operators} are {\it work operators} ({\it re-express, arrange, sequence, re-symbolize, overlay, re-project, pan, zoom, filter, search, retrieve, calculate}) and {\it enabling operators} ({\it import, export, save, edit, annotate}).
    
    With respect to {\it operands}, Roth distinguishes between the {\it search target} ({\it in space alone, in space-in-time, an attribute-in-space}) and {\it search level} ({\it elementary, general}).
    
    Roth arrived at this classification via a series of card-sorting exercises on {\it objectives} and {\it operators} and 15 cartographic\index{cartography} interface designer/developer participants. 
    His rationale for this method: ``{\it One limitation of extant taxonomies contributing to their lack of general adoption is that the majority of these taxonomies are not empirically derived, instead relying on secondary sources or personal experience.}''
    Roth noted a high degree of variability in responses across the {\it objectives}, as there appeared to be some confusion stemming from different {\it operands}.

    A survey and research agenda highlighting challenges in interaction\index{interaction} within the visual analytics\index{visual analytics} community.
    Prior to addressing the research agenda, they provide a domain- and datatype-agnostic classification that spans low-level\index{task!low-level tasks} and high-level tasks\index{task!high-level tasks}, consolidating prior work from the same group by \citet{Amar2004}, \citet{Amar2005}, and \citet{Yi2007}.
    
    The authors state that despite many prior classifications, they see a need to understand a relationship between task/interaction\index{interaction} components and modes of inquiry: {\it abduction} (constructing hypotheses), {\it deduction} (refuting prior hypotheses), {\it induction} (verification, ranking alternative hypotheses, identifying the best explanation).
    
    Among {\it user goals} or {\it tasks}, they distinguish between {\it high-level} ({\it explore, analyze, browse, assimilate, triage, show understand, compare}) and {\it low-level} (from \citet{Amar2005}: {\it retrieve value, filter, sort, compute derived value, find extremum, correlate, determine range, cluster, characterize distribution, find anomalies}).
    
    The authors distinguish between {\it techniques} and {\it intents}, in that the former should never be considered as an ends in itself, but    ``{\it a means to support the user's information understanding}''.
    
    When characterizing {\it interactive visualization}, the authors distinguish between {\it high-level representation intents} ({\it depict, differentiate, identify, show outliers, compare}),  {\it high-level interaction intents} (from \citet{Yi2007}: {\it select, explore, reconfigure, encode\index{visual encoding}, abstract, elaborate, filter, connect}), {\it low-level representation techniques} ({\it charts, graphs, networks\index{network data}, treemaps, parallel coordinates}) and {\it low-level interaction techniques} ({\it selection, brushing\index{view coordination!brushing across views}, dynamic query, pan, zoom}).

    A discussion of post-\ac{WIMP} interfaces and the prospects for visualization tools and techniques. 
    With respect to interaction\index{interaction} in general, the authors characterize how an interaction\index{interaction} begins with an {\it intent}, followed by an {\it action}, which triggers some {\it feedback} from the system and in return a {\it reaction} to that feedback.
    
    They argue: ``{\it InfoVis interaction taxonomies consider the system reaction or the resulting functionality part of the interaction timeline largely discuss interaction from the viewpoint of interaction tasks\index{task} to be performed with and on the data, or from interaction techniques that can be performed on the data or its visual representation. We take a human-centric approach instead and do not specify data or tasks}.''

We continued to refine our meta-analysis of existing classifications, as represented in \autoref{app:typology:fig:cross-cuts}.
These cross-cutting dimensions refer to terms defined by \citet{Chi1998} ({\it temporal} vs. {\it atemporal}), \citet{Roth2012} ({\it objective}, {\it operator}, and {\it operand}, which is in turn influenced by \citet{Norman1988}'s {\it Stages of Action} model), \citet{Chuah1996} ({\it semantic}, {\it syntactic}, and {\it lexical}, \citet{Beaudouin-Lafon2004} ({\it descriptive}, {\it evaluative}, and {\it generative}), and \citet{Kirsh1994} ({\it pragmatic}\index{distributed cognition!pragmatic actions} and {\it epistemic}\index{distributed cognition!epistemic actions}).

I gave a pre-paper talk\footnote{For most papers written by members of the UBC InfoVis group, the lead author will present the paper to the group before it is written in the style of a conference presentation as a means to get feedback on the framing and contributions of the work; for more information, see \url{http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/policy.txt}.} about this project to the UBC InfoVis group, entitled {\it ``Mid-level Task Abstractions for Visualization Design and Evaluation''}\footnote{This was pre-paper talk was our fourth slide presentation, as explained in \autoref{app:typology:meta-analysis}.}.
This talk summarized our meta-analysis and our proposed classification shown in \autoref{app:typology:fig:13.01.09}.

\begin{sloppypar}
The group found our work to be compelling, however there was some confusion regarding the vocabulary that we used (\eg ``{\tt produce}''\index{{\tt produce}} vs. ``{\tt present}''\index{{\tt present}} and ``{\tt explore}''\index{{\tt explore}} vs. ``{\tt enjoy}''\index{{\tt enjoy}}), and whether a consideration of {\it who} was warranted alongside {\it why}, {\it what}, {\it how}, and {\it which}. 
They asked whether our scope accounted for even higher levels of abstract tasks, such as {\it understanding the past}, {\it decision making in the present}, and {\it predicting the future}.
They asked for more concrete examples to explain aspects of our classification.
There was also a question as to whether {\it which} was necessary and if it could be subsumed into the questions of {\it how} and/or {\it what}.
Some were confused about of the dimensions of our meta-analysis, particularly the {\it semantic}, {\it syntactic}, and {\it lexical} dimensions inspired by \citet{Chuah1996}.
The question of supporting evidence for our classification and our methodology also arose, indicating that we would need to thoroughly explain these aspects in subsequent presentations and in our eventual paper.
Finally, there was the question of how to validate our classification, which was not something we had planned to address in the paper; we planned to treat our classification as a proposal, and that validation would follow in subsequent projects over time.

We consolidated the feedback we received in response to our pre-paper talk and refined our ideas and intended contributions over the next two weeks, and in this time we generated three additional iterations of slide presentations, as explained in \autoref{app:typology:meta-analysis}.
We also used this period to clarify our scope: we were not proposing an interaction\index{interaction} taxonomy, nor were we proposing a temporal pipeline model, and we certainly were not planning to enumerate or classify visual encoding\index{visual encoding} choices. 
With respect to {\it what}, we realized that we needed to distinguish {\it data} and {\it views}.
Finally, we realized that too much of our framing was contingent upon a deep familiarity with previous work from our group, namely Tamara's Nested Model~\cite{Munzner2009}\index{nested model (Munzner)}.

He also indicates the {\it ways of playing}: {\it paideia} (primitive, carefree gaiety and fantasy), {\it ludus} (formal play with rules and conventions, involving patience and development of skill), and {\it wan} (the quietly sensual Chinese way of playing; \eg polishing jade). Finally, play is distinguishable from work and represents a voluntary interlude directed by {\it convergent selectivity}, which concerns fads, manners, fashions, taste, etc.}, which accounts for media consumption activities that bring no material gain, serving no ``work'' functions, but instead induce moments of absorption and self-enchantment.
    Casual media consumption relies upon serendipitous {\it apperception}, a readiness to interact with information relating to existing interests.

Our sixth classification is represented in \autoref{app:typology:fig:13.02.25}; this classification was included in a paper draft entitled {\it``Mid-Level Tasks for Visualization Design and Evaluation''}, which we circulated to members of the UBC InfoVis group to invite discussion and criticism.
This version simplified our classification of {\it what} and made the connection to Munzner's nested model~\cite{Munzner2009}\index{nested model (Munzner)} more explicit.

The UBC InfoVis group along with visitor Colin Ware met to discuss our draft: {\it``Mid-Level Tasks for Visualization Design and Evaluation''}.

The group's critique included: (i) they disputed the term {\it mid-level} since we had multiple levels in our classification, and though the {\it why-what-how} division was appreciated (with the strengths being {\it why} and {\it how}), our classification of {\it what} was disputed and was thought to be underdeveloped; (ii) they acknowledged our abundance of motivation but suggested that many readers may not appreciate this motivation without additional context (beyond the Nested Model~\cite{Munzner2009}\index{nested model (Munzner)}), running examples, and use cases; (iii) our claims of {\it evaluative} and {\it generative} power were disputed, as were our claims regarding that our work was {\it actionable} and {\it persuasive}; (iv) some of our task description examples were expressed with a pseudocode-like notation, which was deemed to be confusing, and it was similarly it was unclear as to why we presented the terminology of related work in a table (referring to \autoref{typology:tab:rw:why} and \autoref{typology:tab:rw:how}); (v) finally, they asked us to be more explicit with regards to what was gained with the advent of our classification and why ours was superior to all prior classifications.

\section{Our Proposed Taxonomy of Tasks}
\label{app:typology:chronology:proposed}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

\bstart{March 13, 2013}
Our seventh classification is shown in \autoref{app:typology:fig:13.03.13}; this classification is identical to the typology as it is presented in \autoref{ch:typology} (reproduced in \autoref{app:typology:fig:typology} below) in all aspects save its visual layout, which includes an illustration of a sequence of interdependent tasks\index{task!task sequence}.
In response to feedback from UBC InfoVis group readers and to our recent reading of \citet{Tweedie1997}, we drastically simplified our classification of {\it what} to an even greater extent, reducing it to {\tt input} and {\tt output}.
We also started to refer to our classification as a {\it multi-level taxonomy} as opposed to one classifying {\it mid-level tasks}\index{task!mid-level tasks}. 
We emphasized our taxonomy as resulting from a combination of literature review and new thinking.
We cut back on our discussion of {\it evaluative} and {\it generative} potential, emphasizing the {\it descriptive} power of our classification.
We also dropped the discussion of whether our classification was {\it actionable} or {\it persuasive}~\cite{Gleicher2012}.

    {\it Elementary tasks} include {\it direct lookup} ({\it identification}), {\it inverse lookup} ({\it localization}), {\it direct comparison} ({\it identification and interrelation of characteristics}), {\it inverse comparison} ({\it localization and interrelation of references}), and {\it relation seeking}. 
    
    {\it Synoptic tasks} include {\it descriptive tasks} ({\it direct lookup / pattern definition and identification, inverse lookup / pattern search and localization, direct pattern comparison, inverse pattern comparison, relation seeking}) and {\it connectional tasks} ({\it identify heterogeneous behaviour, identify homogeneous behaviour}).

    Targets for synoptic tasks\index{task} are types of patterns or configurations of {\it characteristics} for a {\it reference set}; they include: {\it association, differentiation, arrangement}, and {\it distribution summary}.

    Smith indicates that ``{\it the key characteristic of a typology is that its dimensions represent concepts rather than empirical cases [and that] typologies create useful heuristics and provide a systematic basis for comparison \ldots Their central drawbacks are categories that are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive}.''
    Taxonomies, on the other hand, ``{\it classify items on the basis of empirically observable and measurable characteristics}.''

    Considered in response an anonymous reviewer who questioned whether we had truly proposed a {\it taxonomy}, implying completeness, indicating that others have use the less strict {\it typology} in this context; we did not cite this work in \autoref{ch:typology} or \citet{Brehmer2013}, opting to cite the original source  \citet{Bailey1994} instead.

    Recommended by an anonymous reviewer who stated that ``{\it The authors will enjoy it}''\footnote{I did enjoy it; thanks R3!}.
    
    Describes {\it cognitive work analysis}\index{cognitive work analysis (Vicente)}, a framework that combines {\it constraint-based task analysis} with {\it work domain analysis}\index{work domain analysis} as the ``{\it foundation for a holistic and socio-technical account of a person's work involving information technology}'', which involves five phases: {\it work domain analysis\index{work domain analysis}, control task analysis, strategies analysis, social organization and cooperation analysis}, and {\it worker competencies analysis}. 
    
    Vicente contrasts {\it normative work analysis} (how work {\it should} be done), {\it descriptive work analysis} (how work {\it is} done, including workarounds and strategies outside of what is prescribed by the normative account of the work), and {\it cognitive work analysis}\index{cognitive work analysis (Vicente)} as a form of {\it formative work analysis} (how work {\it could} be done, subject to known constraints, such as {\it inputs} and {\it outputs}, social organization, and worker competencies). 
    
    The {\it strategies analysis} phase involves describing {\it how} a task is carried out independent of who does it, still in a device-agnostic fashion, examining the different possible strategies by which the task could be executed.
    
    Like us, Vicente appreciates the power and simplicity of asking {\it why, what}, and {\it how} for elucidating {\it means} and {\it ends}, though he is referring to the {\it structural means-ends} relations in a work domain's {\it abstraction hierarchy}, while we are concerned with {\it action means-ends relations} of tasks; in other words, relations between nouns vs. relations between verbs. 
    Finally, Vicente argues that sequence-based approaches to task analysis\index{task!task analysis} are overly rigid and thus inappropriate for describing such open-ended tasks; {\it constraint}-based approaches to task analysis\index{task!task analysis} allow for more flexibility in terms of {\it how}\index{{\tt how}} a task\index{task} is performed.
\end{quotation}

\bstart{June 27, 2013}
Submission of a revision to IEEE Information Visualization, which we renamed {\it``A Multi-Level \underline{Typology} of Abstract Visualization Tasks''}.
In addition to opting to use the term {\it typology} and including the recommended references, we extended the definition for each node of our typology, now including one or more succinct examples, and we also made an effort to disambiguate the terminology flagged by reviewers. 
We added a section providing background context (\autoref{typology:context}) to outline the limitations faced by practitioners conducting task analysis, that previous classifications cannot be used to generate concise and abstract task descriptions needed for design and evaluation. 
Finally, we extended our discussion of {\it what} to include several illustrative example classifications of {\it what} as proposed by previous work (see \autoref{typology:what}).

We submitted a camera-ready version of {\it``A Multi-Level Typology of Abstract Visualization Tasks''} to IEEE Information Visualization.
In this revision, we responded to the meta-reviewer's comments regarding the presentation of the typology in \autoref{app:typology:fig:typology}, clarifying the differences between {\tt discover}\index{{\tt discover}} types {\it generate hypotheses} and {\it verify hypotheses}, the {\it means} and {\it ends} of {\tt produce}\index{{\tt produce}}, the scope of {\tt change}\index{{\tt change}}, and the difference between {\tt annotate} (a verb: {\it how}) and an annotation (a noun: {\it what}).
We also highlighted terms from previous work relating to {\it what} in \autoref{typology:tab:rw:why} and \autoref{typology:tab:rw:how} using parentheses.

\bstart{October 13--18, 2013}
I attended the 2013 IEEE VIS Conference and presented {\it``A Multi-Level Typology of Abstract Visualization Tasks''} in the ``Defining the design space'' InfoVis session, which also included task\index{task} classification papers by \citet{Schulz2013} and \citet{Roth2013}.
Roth's paper was a longer journal version of his 2012 {\it GIScience} workshop paper discussed above~\cite{Roth2012}; his classification remain unchanged.
I comment upon the differences between our typology and ``{\it A Design Space of Visualization Tasks}'' by \citet{Schulz2013} in \autoref{conclusions:typology:contemporary}.
I presented the typology as it is shown in \autoref{ch:typology} and in \autoref{app:typology:fig:typology}; we omitted the illustration of a sequence of interdependent tasks\index{task!task sequence} due to space constraints.
Finally, \autoref{app:typology:fig:slides-4} is one aspect of our meta-analysis of existing classifications that I presented at IEEE VIS 2013.
